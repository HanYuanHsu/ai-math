Level 1,Geometry,1879,"The greatest perimeter of the triangle occurs when the two shorter sides are the base of the triangle and the longest side is the height (forming a right-angled triangle with the altitude to the base). Using Pythagoras' theorem, the length of the longest side is $\sqrt{15^2 - \left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{225 - 25} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$. 

Therefore, the greatest possible perimeter of the isosceles triangle is $2 \times 15 + 10\sqrt{2}$. Simplifying, we get $30 + 10\sqrt{2} \approx 44.14$.

We can find the number of multiples of 13 in this range by calculating $\left\lfloor \frac{988}{13} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{104}{13} \right\rfloor = 76 - 8 = 68$.

Level 2,Precalculus,4698,"Given that $\tan x+\tan y=4$ and $\cot x+\cot y=5$, we can rewrite these equations as
\[\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin y}{\cos y} = 4\]
\[\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} + \frac{\cos y}{\sin y} = 5.\]
Adding these two equations, we get
\[\frac{\sin x + \cos x}{\cos x\sin x} + \frac{\cos x+\sin x}{\cos x\sin x} = 9.\]
This can be simplified to
\[\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} = 9.\]
Since $\frac{2\sin x \cos x}{\sin 2x} = 1$, $\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} = 2$. Thus, we have $\sin 2x = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies that $2x = 30^\circ$, or $x = 15^\circ$.

Similarly, by subtracting the two equations, we have
\[\frac{\sin x - \cos x}{\cos x \sin x} + \frac{\cos x - \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = -1,\]
and simplifying this gives
\[\frac{1}{\sin x \cos x} = -1.\]
This implies that $\sin 2x = -1$. Since the sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, this tells us that $2x=270^\circ$, or $x = 135^\circ$.

Since $\tan(x+y) = \frac{\tan x + \tan y}{1-\tan x \tan y}$, $\tan(x+y) = \frac{4}{1-4} = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}$."

The proportion of the dartboard that is non-shaded is $\frac{16\pi}{36\pi} = \frac{4}{9}$. Therefore, we expect $\frac{4}{9} \cdot 9 = \boxed{4}$ darts to land in the non-shaded region."

Level 3,Intermediate Algebra,2991,"The center of the ellipse is $(0,0)$, and the foci are at $(c,0)$ and $(-c,0)$ where $c = \sqrt{k - 1}.$ 

The distance between the foci is $2c = 2\sqrt{k - 1}.$ Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. The tangency points on the $x$-axis are $(r,0)$ and $(-r,0)$. The distance between the foci is equal to $2\sqrt{r^2 - (r-1)^2}.$

We have $2\sqrt{k - 1} = 2\sqrt{r^2 - (r-1)^2}.$ Squaring both sides gives $k - 1 = r^2 - (r-1)^2.$ 

Solving this equation gives $k - 1 = 2r - 1$, or $r = \frac{k}{2}.$ Since the circle passes through both foci, we have $F_1F_2 = 2r = \sqrt{k-1},$ giving $k-1 = 4r^2 = 4\left(\frac{k}{2}\right)^2 = k^2.$ 

Solving this gives $k = \boxed{1}$"

Level 3,Number Theory,3272,The prime factorization of $36$ is $2^2 \cdot 3^2$. The sum of all positive factors of $36$ can be calculated using the formula for the sum of divisors of a number: $(1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 3 + 3^2) = (1+2+4)(1+3+9) = 7 \cdot 13 = \boxed{91}$.

Number of four-digit integers starting from 2000: $2999 - 2000 + 1 = 1000$.

Therefore, the number of four-digit integers between 2000 and 8000 is $2000 - 1000 = 1000$.

Level 3,Precalculus,4892,"We have the following relationships in a triangle:

\[\begin{aligned} A &= \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \\ &= \frac{1}{2}ac \sin B \\ &= \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \end{aligned}\]

Therefore, \[(b \sin C)(b \cos C + c \cos B) = b^2 \sin C \cos C + bc \sin C \cos B = \frac{1}{2}b^2 \sin 2C + \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2}bc(\sin A + \sin 2C).\]

From the Law of Sines, we know that $\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C} = 2R,$ so $\sin A + \sin 2C = \frac{a}{b} \sin A + 2 \sin C \cos C = \frac{a}{b} \sin A + \sin 2C = \frac{2R}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{2R} + \sin 2C = \frac{c}{b} + \sin 2C = \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{bc} + \sin 2C.$

Then, $\frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{bc} = \frac{1}{2},$ and $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A$ implies that $\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 0,$ so $\angle A = 90^\circ,$ and $S = \frac{1}{2}bc = \frac{42}{2} = \boxed{21}.$"

Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times \left( 3 \times \frac{23}{7} \right)$

Level 4,Intermediate Algebra,2271,"The center of the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ is at the origin $(0,0)$. The radius of this circle is $\sqrt{1}=1$.

The point $(0,1)$ on this circle is the point of tangency of the square. Since the square is tangent to the circle, the line connecting the center of the circle to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the side of the square at the point of tangency. Thus, the line connecting the center of the circle to the point of tangency has the equation $y=-x+1$. 

Since the two points of tangency on the sides of the square are midpoint between the points of intersection of the circles, the line intersects the circle $x^2+y^2=4$ at the points $(\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{5})$ and $(-\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{5})$. 

Thus, the side length of the square is $2\sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2}-1=\frac{2\sqrt{10}-5}{5}$.

Level 5,Algebra,143,"Let's square the first equation to get $a^2b^4 = \frac{729}{25}$. 

Now, we can multiply this by $a^2b = 135$ (the second equation) to get $a^4b^5 = 729$. 

So, $ab = \sqrt{729} = 27$, given $ab^2 = \frac{27}{5}$. 

Thus, $b = \frac{27}{ab} = \frac{27}{27} = 1$. 

Similarly, $a = \frac{27}{b^2} = \frac{27}{1} = 27$. 

Therefore, $a + 5b = 27 + 5 = \boxed{32}$."
Level 5,Counting & Probability,1194,"We can solve this using stars and bars, or balls and urns. There are three types of cookies, so we can think of them as three ""urns"". We need to distribute 6 cookies among 3 urns, which is equivalent to placing 2 bars among 3 urns. This gives us $\binom{2+3}{3} = \binom{5}{3} = \boxed{10}$ different assortments of six cookies that can be selected."
Level 5,Counting & Probability,1281,"The total number of squares of all sizes in the grid can be determined by the sum of squares of each size. The $3 \times n$ grid contributes squares of sizes $1 \times 1$, $2 \times 2$, and $3 \times 3$. 

Number of size $1 \times 1$ squares: $(3)(n)$

Number of size $2 \times 2$ squares: $(2)(n-1)$

Number of size $3 \times 3$ squares: $(1)(n-2)$

Summing these up, we have $3n + 2n - 2 + n - 2 = 6n - 4$.

From the problem, $6n - 4 = 70 \Rightarrow n = \boxed{12}$."
Level 5,Geometry,1791,"The area of a parallelogram formed by the lines $y=a_1x+b_1$ and $y=a_2x+b_2$ is $|a_1b_2-a_2b_1|$. 

Given the areas of the two parallelograms, we have
\begin{align*}
|a(d-c)-b(d-c)| &= 18 \implies |a-b||c-d| = 18\\
|a(d+c)-b(d+c)| &= 72 \implies |a-b||c+d| = 72
\end{align*}
The values of $|a-b|$ and $|c \pm d|$ must be factors of 18 and 72, respectively. The possible combinations are $(|a-b|, |c-d|) = (1,18)$ and $(|a-b|, |c+d|) = (8,9)$.

Since $a, b, c, d$ are positive integers, the minimum values that satisfy these equations are $a=10, b=1, c=2, d=8$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $a+b+c+d$ is $10 + 1 + 2 + 8 = \boxed{21}$."
Level 5,Geometry,1733,"The volume of the right rectangular prism $ABCDEFGH$ is four times the volume of pyramid $ABCH$. Since the volume of pyramid $ABCH$ is 20, the volume of the right rectangular prism $ABCDEFGH$ is $20 \times 4 = \boxed{80}$."
Level 5,Intermediate Algebra,2614,"Let $x = a + b + c.$ Then by expanding the given equations, we have
$x + (ab + bc + ca) = 1,$
$x + 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2,$
$x + 3(ab + bc + ca) = 3.$

Subtracting the first two equations gives $ab + bc + ca = 1,$ and subtracting the last two equations gives $ab + bc + ca = 1,$ which means that $ab + bc + ca = 1$ for all $a,b,c$ that satisfy the given conditions.

From the equation $ab + bc + ca = 1,$ we have
$(a + 4)(b + 4)(c + 4) = a^2b + b^2c + c^2a + 16(ab + bc + ca) = a^2b + b^2c + c^2a + 16.$

By Vieta's formulas, $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - xt^2 + (ab + bc + ca) t - abc = 0.$ Since the polynomial $t^3 - xt^2 + t - abc = 0$ is satisfied for all $t,$ this means $x = 3,$ so $a + 4,$ $b + 4,$ $c + 4$ are the roots of the polynomial $t^3 - 3t^2 + t - (a + 4)(b + 4)(c + 4) = 0.$ By Vieta's formulas, the coefficient of $t$ in this polynomial is $3,$ so the sum of its roots is $3.$ Thus, $(a + 4)(b + 4)(c + 4) = \boxed{13}.$"
Level 5,Intermediate Algebra,2146,"Let $A = \frac{x^2}{n^2-1} + \frac{y^2}{n^2-3^2}+\frac{z^2}{n^2-5^2}+\frac{w^2}{n^2-7^2}.$

Summing all equations, we get
\begin{align*} 4A + 16A + 36A + 64A &= 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\ 120A &= 7 \\ A &= \frac{7}{120}. \end{align*}Thus $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2 = \frac{7}{120} \cdot 4 = \boxed{\frac{7}{30}}.$"
Level 5,Number Theory,3574,"Since $9$ is its own inverse $\pmod m$, we have $9^2 \equiv 1\pmod m$, which implies $m$ divides $80$.
Since $3$ is not its own inverse $\pmod m$, we must have $3^2 \not\equiv 1 \pmod m$, which implies $m$ does not divide $8$.

Hence, the possible values for $m$ are the factors of $80$ that do not divide $8$: $1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80.$

Therefore, there are $\boxed{6}$ possible values for $m$."
Level 5,Number Theory,3167,"The greatest common divisor of any set of numbers is always 1 as all positive integers share 1 as a common divisor.

Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all the members in the set containing numbers that are the product of four consecutive positive integers is $\boxed{1}$."
Level 5,Prealgebra,3838,"The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $180(n-2)$. Since each interior angle of this polygon is 170 degrees, we can set up the equation $170n = 180(n-2)$. 

Solving for $n$:

$170n = 180n - 360$

$10n = 360$

$n = 36$

Therefore, the polygon has $\boxed{36}$ sides."
Level 5,Prealgebra,4238,"Let's first find the number of positive integers with odd number of digits less than $10^n$ by considering cases when $n=1,2,3, \ldots$. When $n=1$, all single digit numbers are included, so there are 9 numbers. When $n=2$, all two-digit numbers are included, so there are $90-9=81$ numbers. Similarly, for $n=3$, there are $900-90=810$ numbers, and so on. We can generalize this by observing that for $10^n$, there are $10^n-10^{n-1}=9 \cdot 10^{n-1}$ numbers with an odd number of digits.

Therefore, the $1000^{\rm th}$ positive integer with an odd number of digits can be found by solving the equation $9 \cdot 10^{n-1} = 1000$. Simplifying, we get $10^{n-1} = \frac{1000}{9} = 111.\overline{1}$. Since $10^3 = 1000$, we know that the $1000^{\rm th}$ positive integer with an odd number of digits lies in the range $10^3$ to $10^4$, inclusive. 

Hence, the $1000^{\rm th}$ positive integer with an odd number of digits is $\boxed{1999}$."
Level 5,Precalculus,4642,"The values of $x$ for which $\sin(k\pi x)$ is undefined are when $k\pi x$ is an odd multiple of $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which occurs when $x$ is an integer or $\frac12$ plus an integer. 
So, the points of discontinuity are $x=0,1,\frac12$. 

Thus, the intersection of the domain of $f(x)$ with the interval $[0,1]$ consists of the intervals $(0,1)\backslash\left\{\frac12\right\}$, which is one open interval. 

Therefore, $n=\boxed{1}$."
Level 5,Precalculus,4880,"The equation $\frac{1}{5}\log_2 x = \sin (5\pi x)$ can be rewritten as $\log_2 x = 5\sin (5\pi x)$. Since $-1 \leq \sin (5\pi x) \leq 1$, the only time when $5\sin (5\pi x)$ is in the range of $\log_2 x$ is when $5 \sin(5\pi x) = 1$, which occurs when $\sin(5\pi x) = \frac{1}{5}$ which implies $5\pi x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2 \pi k$ where $k$ is an integer. This simplifies to $x = \frac{61}{150} + \frac{2}{5}k$. Since this is in the range $[1,\infty)$, $x$ must also be in that range. Thus, the only possible answer in the range is $\boxed{1}$."
